<h3> A Codecademy Challenge Project</h3>
<h2>v.1. Responsive down to 768px</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This is a flexbox project from the Codecademy Front-End Engineer Path. The project listed a series of open-ended requirements which were used to build this website. Doggone Pet Services is a business of my own creation, and responds dynamically <b>(up to 768px v.1. awaiting JavaScript instruction)</b> as the screen is adjusted.

<h2>Project Requirements</h2>

  <li>Custom styles for other properties, such as colors, fonts, and other layout properties such as borders and padding</li>
